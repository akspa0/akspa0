- Hi, I’m @akspa0
- I’m interested in AI, Data Analysis, productivity improvement, audio separation, audio mixing, automated workflows, video gaming
- I’m currently attempting to rebuild pre-alpha World of Warcraft - https://github.com/akspa0/parp
- I've built a work in process tool for parsing lots of strange/unused World of Warcraft files (C#, both a library and cli tool) - [WoWToolbox v3](https://github.com/akspa0/parp-tools/tree/main/PM4Tool)
- I built a neat tool for processing any audio data into context-rich transcripts, image and video outputs via ComfyUI, automated audio editing, and much more (Python) - https://github.com/akspa0/The-Machine
